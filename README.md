# fleet-management-api-data-validation-app
This is a small app based on Nodejs(express) and React that demonstrates the data fetched from the api as xml and converting it to json
and validating the data. As there is no endpoint to call for xml I am using data.xml as a mock file that serves the purpose of endpoint
which should return xml.
